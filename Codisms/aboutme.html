                        As Taylor Swift's iconic lyric said, I'm the problem. Hi! I am Cedric Noel J. Elagio, 14 years old, from Mexico, Pampaga. I live in a tiny subdivision where life is peaceful yet chaotic at the same time. The day I was born was on December 19, 2007. I graduated grade school at the University of the Assumption and then transferred to PSHS for quality education and clout. I like to play online games (Genshin, Valorant, Mobile Legends), watch K-Dramas, and do whatever I feel like doing. You can also call me a professional mental breakdown-er
                        <br><br>
                        I chose Taylor Swift as she is simply the music industry. Lyricist, Producer, Singer, Songwriter, Overachiever, Emotional Hurter, Record Breaker, she is a wildcard. She also serves as an inspiration to many women who have lost their spark due to our judgemental society. In a condensed form, she is the moment.
